# Hostel Meal Management System

#### Fully functional and automated system with authentication and authorization to manage the meals of students. This systhem is built on MERN Technology with some Advanced feturies.

### Let's have look to the kye Feturies of this system:

- `Admin` Authorization
- `E-mail/Password` or `Google` Authentication
- General user can `like` and `comment` on a meal and this data will be stored `user wise`
- User can purchase a package by `Stripe` payment
- User can `Request` for a meal
- User can see his/her `Reviews` and `Requested` meals from his/her Dashboard
- User can `Edit` his/her Review
- User can `Cancle` his/her Requested meal if it is `Pending`
- An Admin can make any User to `Admin`
- Admin can `Delete` a meal and that meal's data will be deleted from `user's data` also if that meal was `liked` by him/her
- Admin can `Add a Meal`
- Admin can `Updify & Delete` a Meal
- Admin can Delete any `Review`
- Admin can make a requested meal `Delivered from Pending` by `Serving` the meal
- Admin can Review all the `Payments`
- Without and `Admin-Role` nobody can access both `Server-Side` or `Client-Side` Routes
- `Infinity Scrolling` on Meals Page

### All the optional tasks, I have done:

- Implemented the `About Me` section on the Userâ€™s My Profile Page
- Implemented `React-Awesome-Button` & `React-Select`
- Implemented `React-Modal`
- Implemented `Axios Interceptor`

### Here are Admin Credentials:

- Admin E-mail : `akibrahman5200@gmail.com`
- Admin Password : `aaaaaa@`
